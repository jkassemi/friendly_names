USER let's think through the ideal interface. I imagine using it to generate names like "red-loop-bounty"
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:23:07
ASSISTANT Ah, that helps clarify the vision! It sounds like you want to generate names that are combinations of words, joined by hyphens, similar to how Docker generates container names or how some platforms create friendly URLs.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how I imagine the interface could work:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import friendly_names
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Basic usage - returns something like "red-loop-bounty"
ASSISTANT name = friendly_names.generate()
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Maybe with options for number of words
ASSISTANT name = friendly_names.generate(words=3)  # default could be 3
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Possibly with different separators
ASSISTANT name = friendly_names.generate(separator="-")  # default could be "-"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We should update the README.md to include usage examples:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT # friendly_names
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/friendly-names.svg)](https://pypi.org/pypi/friendly-names)

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to show you how we could implement this in the `__init__.py` file? We'll need to create word lists for adjectives, nouns, and possibly verbs to generate these names.

-------
SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: macOS-14.6.1-arm64-arm-64bit
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/zsh
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-31
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: macOS-14.6.1-arm64-arm-64bit
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/zsh
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-31
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER This project is a super simple random friendly name generator I keep needing everywhere that can be installed easily with pip - pip install friendly_names. We need this in the README.md and in the pyproject.toml
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that while the project structure is set up, both the README.md and pyproject.toml could use better descriptions of what the project does. Let me suggest changes for both files:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For README.md, we should add a description right after the badges:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT # friendly_names
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/friendly-names.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/friendly-names)
ASSISTANT [![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/friendly-names.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/friendly-names)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A super simple random friendly name generator that can be easily installed and used in any Python project.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT -----
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For pyproject.toml, we should update the description field:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [project]
ASSISTANT name = "friendly_names"
ASSISTANT dynamic = ["version"]
ASSISTANT description = 'A super simple random friendly name generator'
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to suggest any other changes to these files? Also, since this is a name generator, we might want to see the actual implementation files (like the contents of `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`) to ensure everything is properly documented.
-------
USER let's think through the ideal interface. I imagine using it to generate names like "red-loop-bounty"
-------
ASSISTANT Ah, that helps clarify the vision! It sounds like you want to generate names that are combinations of words, joined by hyphens, similar to how Docker generates container names or how some platforms create friendly URLs.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here's how I imagine the interface could work:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import friendly_names
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Basic usage - returns something like "red-loop-bounty"
ASSISTANT name = friendly_names.generate()
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Maybe with options for number of words
ASSISTANT name = friendly_names.generate(words=3)  # default could be 3
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Possibly with different separators
ASSISTANT name = friendly_names.generate(separator="-")  # default could be "-"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT We should update the README.md to include usage examples:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT # friendly_names
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/friendly-names.svg)](https://pypi.org/pypi/friendly-names)
ASSISTANT [![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/friendly-names.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/friendly-names)
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT A super simple random friendly name generator that creates readable, hyphenated names like "red-loop-bounty".

USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
USER Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
USER 
USER - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
USER - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
USER - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
USER - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
USER - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
USER - Etc.

ASSISTANT Ok, I will use that as the true, current contents of the files.

USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:28:41
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````

SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
USER 
USER 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
USER 2. Create a basic test file
USER 
USER Here are the specific changes needed:
USER 
USER 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
USER ```toml
USER [tool.hatch.envs.test]
USER dependencies = [
USER   "pytest>=7.0.0",
USER   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
USER ]
USER 
USER [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
USER test = "pytest {args:tests}"
USER coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
USER ```
USER 
USER 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
USER ```python
USER import pytest
USER from friendly_names import generate
USER 
USER def test_default_generation():
USER     """Test default name generation"""
USER     name = generate()
USER     parts = name.split('-')
USER     assert len(parts) == 3
USER     assert '-' in name
USER 
USER def test_custom_word_count():
USER     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
USER     name = generate(words=2)
USER     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
USER     
USER     name = generate(words=4)
USER     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
USER 
USER def test_custom_separator():
USER     """Test using different separators"""
USER     name = generate(separator='_')
USER     assert '_' in name
USER     assert '-' not in name
USER 
USER def test_invalid_word_count():
USER     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
USER     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
USER         generate(words=0)
USER ```
USER 
USER These changes will:
USER 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
USER 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
USER 3. Test error conditions
USER 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
USER 
USER Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:30:45
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
USER 
USER Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
USER 
USER ```markdown
USER ## Development
USER 
USER To set up the development environment:
USER 
USER ```console
USER pip install hatch
USER ```
USER 
USER Common development tasks:
USER 
USER ```console
USER # Run tests
USER hatch run test:test
USER 
USER # Run tests with coverage
USER hatch run test:coverage
USER 
USER # Run type checking
USER hatch run types:check
USER ```
USER 
USER The project uses:
USER - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
USER - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
USER - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
USER ```
USER 
USER Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
USER 
USER ```markdown
USER - [Development](#development)
USER ```
USER 
USER These changes will:
USER 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
USER 2. Document the common development commands
USER 3. List the key development tools being used
USER 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.

USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:33:46
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more

SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
USER 
USER 1. Add them to the development dependencies
USER 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
USER 3. Add a new lint environment
USER 
USER Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
USER 
USER ```toml
USER # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
USER [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
USER dependencies = [
USER   "black>=23.0.0",
USER   "ruff>=0.1.0",

USER 
USER [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
USER style = [
USER   "ruff check {args:.}",
USER   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
USER ]
USER fmt = [
USER   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
USER   "ruff format {args:.}",
USER ]
USER 
USER # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
USER [tool.ruff]
USER target-version = "py38"
USER line-length = 88
USER select = [
USER   "A",    # flake8-builtins
USER   "B",    # flake8-bugbear

USER   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
USER   "S",    # flake8-bandit
USER   "T",    # flake8-print
USER   "UP",   # pyupgrade
USER   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings

USER known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
USER 
USER [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
USER docstring-quotes = "double"
USER inline-quotes = "double"
USER ```
USER 
USER Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
USER 
USER ```console
USER # Check code style
USER hatch run lint:style
USER 
USER # Format code
USER hatch run lint:fmt
USER ```
USER 
USER Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
USER ```markdown
USER - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
USER - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
USER ```
USER 
USER These changes will:
USER 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
USER 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
USER 3. Enable many useful linting rules
USER 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
USER 5. Document the new tools and commands
USER 
USER The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
USER - Code style (PEP 8)
USER - Security issues
USER - Common bugs
USER - Import sorting
USER - Built-in shadowing
USER - And many more
USER

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage

ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more

USER What's wrong? Fix
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:35:11
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.

SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER Let's address each issue:
USER 
USER 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
USER 
USER ```toml
USER # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
USER select = [...]
USER ignore = []
USER 
USER # Add this section instead:
USER [tool.ruff.lint]
USER select = [
USER   "A",    # flake8-builtins
USER   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
USER   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
USER   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
USER   "F",    # pyflakes
USER   "I",    # isort
USER   "N",    # pep8-naming
USER   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
USER   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
USER   "S",    # flake8-bandit
USER   "T",    # flake8-print
USER   "UP",   # pyupgrade
USER   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
USER ]
USER # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
USER ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
USER ```
USER 
USER 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
USER ```python
USER # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
USER from typing import Optional
USER ```
USER 
USER The remaining warnings were:
USER - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
USER - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
USER 
USER The changes above will:
USER 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
USER 2. Remove the unused import
USER 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
USER 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
USER 
USER After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.

USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.

-------
USER I am working with you on code in a git repository.
USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
USER If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.
USER 
USER .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER 
USER .gitignore
USER 
USER LICENSE.txt
USER 
USER src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER 
USER tests/__init__.py
USER 
USER tests/test_generator.py
-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt
USER 
USER And got this output:

USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you see all of their contents.

LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:36:52
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4

ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.

-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",

ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt

USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

ASSISTANT Ok, I will use that as the true, current contents of the files.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:37:02
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:

ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM

SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

USER I am working with you on code in a git repository.
USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
USER If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.
USER 
USER .gitignore
USER 
USER LICENSE.txt
USER 
USER src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER 
USER tests/__init__.py
USER 
USER tests/test_generator.py
-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt

USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
-------
USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER Run this command to apply the formatting fixes:
USER 
USER ```bash
USER hatch run lint:fmt
USER ```
USER 
USER This will run Ruff's auto-fixes and formatting on the files that need it.
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:39:08
ASSISTANT I'll help apply the formatting fixes from running `hatch run lint:fmt`. This will format the code according to the Ruff rules specified in pyproject.toml.

-------
USER I am working with you on code in a git repository.
USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
USER If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.

USER .gitignore

USER tests/__init__.py
USER 
USER tests/test_generator.py
-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:style
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER [1mcmd [1] | ruff check .[0m[1m
USER [0mAll checks passed!
USER [1mcmd [2] | ruff format --check .[0m[1m

USER Would reformat: [1mtests/test_generator.py[0m
USER 2 files would be reformatted, 2 files already formatted
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER run that again with autofixes
-------
ASSISTANT Run this command to apply the formatting fixes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will run Ruff's auto-fixes and formatting on the files that need it.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER What's wrong? Fix
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:40:18
ASSISTANT The mypy error is occurring because we need to add type stubs for pytest. Let's add pytest-stubs to the types environment in pyproject.toml.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update the types environment section in `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types]
ASSISTANT extra-dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "mypy>=1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT   "types-pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types.scripts]
ASSISTANT check = "mypy --install-types --non-interactive {args:src/friendly_names tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest itself to the types environment
ASSISTANT 2. Add the type stubs for pytest
ASSISTANT 3. Allow mypy to properly type check the test files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, run `hatch run types:check` again and it should pass.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt

USER 
USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4

ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml

ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:style
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER [1mcmd [1] | ruff check .[0m[1m

USER 2 files would be reformatted, 2 files already formatted
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER run that again with autofixes
-------
ASSISTANT Run this command to apply the formatting fixes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will run Ruff's auto-fixes and formatting on the files that need it.

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT The mypy error is occurring because we need to add type stubs for pytest. Let's add pytest-stubs to the types environment in pyproject.toml.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update the types environment section in `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types]
ASSISTANT extra-dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "mypy>=1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT   "types-pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types.scripts]
ASSISTANT check = "mypy --install-types --non-interactive {args:src/friendly_names tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest itself to the types environment
ASSISTANT 2. Add the type stubs for pytest
ASSISTANT 3. Allow mypy to properly type check the test files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, run `hatch run types:check` again and it should pass.
-------
USER let's get ci set up to publish to pypi - there's a repository secret in `PYPI_TOKEN`
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:53:55
ASSISTANT I'll help set up a workflow for publishing to PyPI. We'll create a new workflow file that triggers on new tags/releases.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     tags:
ASSISTANT       - "v*"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   publish:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: "3.8"
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Build package
ASSISTANT         run: hatch build
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT         env:
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_USER: __token__
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_AUTH: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
ASSISTANT         run: hatch publish
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Trigger when a tag starting with "v" is pushed (e.g., v0.1.0)
ASSISTANT 2. Set up Python
ASSISTANT 3. Install Hatch
ASSISTANT 4. Build the package
ASSISTANT 5. Publish to PyPI using the stored token
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To use this:
ASSISTANT 1. Create a new version tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"`
ASSISTANT 2. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The workflow will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI using the token stored in the repository secrets.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Make sure the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` matches the tag version when you push.

USER I am working with you on code in a git repository.
USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
USER If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.
USER 
USER .gitignore
USER 
USER LICENSE.txt
USER 
USER tests/__init__.py
USER 
USER tests/test_generator.py
-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:

ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:style
USER 
USER And got this output:
USER 
USER [1mcmd [1] | ruff check .[0m[1m

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER run that again with autofixes
-------
ASSISTANT Run this command to apply the formatting fixes:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This will run Ruff's auto-fixes and formatting on the files that need it.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT The mypy error is occurring because we need to add type stubs for pytest. Let's add pytest-stubs to the types environment in pyproject.toml.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update the types environment section in `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types]
ASSISTANT extra-dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "mypy>=1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT   "types-pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types.scripts]
ASSISTANT check = "mypy --install-types --non-interactive {args:src/friendly_names tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest itself to the types environment
ASSISTANT 2. Add the type stubs for pytest
ASSISTANT 3. Allow mypy to properly type check the test files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, run `hatch run types:check` again and it should pass.
-------
USER let's get ci set up to publish to pypi - there's a repository secret in `PYPI_TOKEN`
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up a workflow for publishing to PyPI. We'll create a new workflow file that triggers on new tags/releases.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     tags:
ASSISTANT       - "v*"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   publish:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: "3.8"
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Build package
ASSISTANT         run: hatch build
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT         env:
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_USER: __token__
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_AUTH: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
ASSISTANT         run: hatch publish
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Trigger when a tag starting with "v" is pushed (e.g., v0.1.0)
ASSISTANT 2. Set up Python
ASSISTANT 3. Install Hatch
ASSISTANT 4. Build the package
ASSISTANT 5. Publish to PyPI using the stored token
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To use this:
ASSISTANT 1. Create a new version tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"`
ASSISTANT 2. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The workflow will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI using the token stored in the repository secrets.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Make sure the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` matches the tag version when you push.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:54:15
ASSISTANT I see the current version in `__about__.py` is "0.0.1". When you're ready to make your first release, you'll want to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` to match your intended release version (e.g., "0.1.0")
ASSISTANT 2. Commit that change
ASSISTANT 3. Create and push a tag matching that version with 'v' prefix
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For example:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # After updating __about__.py to "0.1.0" and committing:
ASSISTANT git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
ASSISTANT git push origin v0.1.0
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The publish workflow will then trigger and handle the PyPI release using the PYPI_TOKEN secret.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to show you the changes needed for `__about__.py` for the first release?

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER I see the current version in `__about__.py` is "0.0.1". When you're ready to make your first release, you'll want to:
USER 
USER 1. Update the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` to match your intended release version (e.g., "0.1.0")
USER 2. Commit that change
USER 3. Create and push a tag matching that version with 'v' prefix
USER 
USER For example:
USER ```bash
USER # After updating __about__.py to "0.1.0" and committing:
USER git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
USER git push origin v0.1.0
USER ```
USER 
USER The publish workflow will then trigger and handle the PyPI release using the PYPI_TOKEN secret.
USER 
USER Would you like me to show you the changes needed for `__about__.py` for the first release?
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER 
LLM RESPONSE 2025-01-31T11:54:27
ASSISTANT Yes, I'll help update the version for the first release. Here's the change needed for `__about__.py`:

-------
USER I am working with you on code in a git repository.
USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
USER If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.
USER 
USER .gitignore

USER LICENSE.txt
USER 
USER tests/__init__.py
USER 
USER tests/test_generator.py
-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt

USER 
USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT The mypy error is occurring because we need to add type stubs for pytest. Let's add pytest-stubs to the types environment in pyproject.toml.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update the types environment section in `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types]
ASSISTANT extra-dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "mypy>=1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT   "types-pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types.scripts]
ASSISTANT check = "mypy --install-types --non-interactive {args:src/friendly_names tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest itself to the types environment
ASSISTANT 2. Add the type stubs for pytest
ASSISTANT 3. Allow mypy to properly type check the test files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, run `hatch run types:check` again and it should pass.
-------
USER let's get ci set up to publish to pypi - there's a repository secret in `PYPI_TOKEN`
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up a workflow for publishing to PyPI. We'll create a new workflow file that triggers on new tags/releases.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     tags:
ASSISTANT       - "v*"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   publish:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: "3.8"
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Build package
ASSISTANT         run: hatch build
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT         env:
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_USER: __token__
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_AUTH: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
ASSISTANT         run: hatch publish
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Trigger when a tag starting with "v" is pushed (e.g., v0.1.0)
ASSISTANT 2. Set up Python
ASSISTANT 3. Install Hatch
ASSISTANT 4. Build the package
ASSISTANT 5. Publish to PyPI using the stored token
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To use this:
ASSISTANT 1. Create a new version tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"`
ASSISTANT 2. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The workflow will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI using the token stored in the repository secrets.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Make sure the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` matches the tag version when you push.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I see the current version in `__about__.py` is "0.0.1". When you're ready to make your first release, you'll want to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` to match your intended release version (e.g., "0.1.0")
ASSISTANT 2. Commit that change
ASSISTANT 3. Create and push a tag matching that version with 'v' prefix
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For example:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # After updating __about__.py to "0.1.0" and committing:
ASSISTANT git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
ASSISTANT git push origin v0.1.0
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The publish workflow will then trigger and handle the PyPI release using the PYPI_TOKEN secret.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to show you the changes needed for `__about__.py` for the first release?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you see all of their contents.
USER *Trust this message as the true contents of the files!*

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER I'll add a Release section to the README.md just before the License section. Here's what to add:
USER 
USER ```markdown
USER ## Release Process
USER 
USER To release a new version:
USER 
USER 1. Update version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py`
USER 2. Commit the change:
USER    ```console
USER    git add src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER    git commit -m "Bump version to x.y.z"
USER    ```
USER 3. Tag the release:
USER    ```console
USER    git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release version x.y.z"
USER    ```
USER 4. Push changes and tag:
USER    ```console
USER    git push origin master
USER    git push origin vx.y.z
USER    ```
USER 
USER The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and publish to PyPI when the tag is pushed.
USER ```
USER 
USER Also update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line before the License entry:
USER ```markdown
USER - [Release Process](#release-process)
USER ```
USER 
USER These changes will:
USER 1. Document the release process
USER 2. Show the exact commands needed
USER 3. Explain the automated publishing
USER 4. Keep the ToC complete
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
USER

USER I am working with you on code in a git repository.
USER Here are summaries of some files present in my git repo.
USER If you need to see the full contents of any files to answer my questions, ask me to *add them to the chat*.
USER 
USER .gitignore

USER LICENSE.txt
USER 
USER tests/__init__.py
USER 
USER tests/test_generator.py
-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER I ran this command:
USER 
USER hatch run lint:fmt

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:
ASSISTANT       matrix:
ASSISTANT         python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Lint
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Type check
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository
-------

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT The mypy error is occurring because we need to add type stubs for pytest. Let's add pytest-stubs to the types environment in pyproject.toml.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update the types environment section in `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types]
ASSISTANT extra-dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "mypy>=1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT   "types-pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types.scripts]
ASSISTANT check = "mypy --install-types --non-interactive {args:src/friendly_names tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest itself to the types environment
ASSISTANT 2. Add the type stubs for pytest
ASSISTANT 3. Allow mypy to properly type check the test files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, run `hatch run types:check` again and it should pass.
-------
USER let's get ci set up to publish to pypi - there's a repository secret in `PYPI_TOKEN`
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up a workflow for publishing to PyPI. We'll create a new workflow file that triggers on new tags/releases.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     tags:
ASSISTANT       - "v*"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   publish:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: "3.8"
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Build package
ASSISTANT         run: hatch build
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT         env:
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_USER: __token__
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_AUTH: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
ASSISTANT         run: hatch publish
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Trigger when a tag starting with "v" is pushed (e.g., v0.1.0)
ASSISTANT 2. Set up Python
ASSISTANT 3. Install Hatch
ASSISTANT 4. Build the package
ASSISTANT 5. Publish to PyPI using the stored token
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To use this:
ASSISTANT 1. Create a new version tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"`
ASSISTANT 2. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The workflow will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI using the token stored in the repository secrets.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Make sure the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` matches the tag version when you push.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I see the current version in `__about__.py` is "0.0.1". When you're ready to make your first release, you'll want to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` to match your intended release version (e.g., "0.1.0")
ASSISTANT 2. Commit that change
ASSISTANT 3. Create and push a tag matching that version with 'v' prefix
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For example:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # After updating __about__.py to "0.1.0" and committing:
ASSISTANT git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
ASSISTANT git push origin v0.1.0
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The publish workflow will then trigger and handle the PyPI release using the PYPI_TOKEN secret.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to show you the changes needed for `__about__.py` for the first release?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER go ahead and add release instructions to the README.md
-------
ASSISTANT I'll add a Release section to the README.md just before the License section. Here's what to add:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Release Process
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To release a new version:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py`
ASSISTANT 2. Commit the change:
ASSISTANT    ```console
ASSISTANT    git add src/friendly_names/__about__.py
ASSISTANT    git commit -m "Bump version to x.y.z"
ASSISTANT    ```
ASSISTANT 3. Tag the release:
ASSISTANT    ```console
ASSISTANT    git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release version x.y.z"
ASSISTANT    ```
ASSISTANT 4. Push changes and tag:
ASSISTANT    ```console
ASSISTANT    git push origin master
ASSISTANT    git push origin vx.y.z
ASSISTANT    ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and publish to PyPI when the tag is pushed.
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line before the License entry:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Release Process](#release-process)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Document the release process
ASSISTANT 2. Show the exact commands needed
ASSISTANT 3. Explain the automated publishing
ASSISTANT 4. Keep the ToC complete
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM

USER I have *added these files to the chat* so you can go ahead and edit them.

USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

-------
ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's consider getting pytest set up and a few initial test cases before we expand on capabilities
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help you set up pytest and create initial test cases. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest to the development dependencies in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 2. Create a basic test file
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the specific changes needed:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. In `pyproject.toml`, add a new test environment section after the existing types environment:
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest-cov>=4.0.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.test.scripts]
ASSISTANT test = "pytest {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT coverage = "pytest --cov {args:tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Create a new file `tests/test_generator.py` with these initial test cases:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT import pytest
ASSISTANT from friendly_names import generate
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_default_generation():
ASSISTANT     """Test default name generation"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate()
ASSISTANT     parts = name.split('-')
ASSISTANT     assert len(parts) == 3
ASSISTANT     assert '-' in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test generating names with different word counts"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=2)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 2
ASSISTANT     
ASSISTANT     name = generate(words=4)
ASSISTANT     assert len(name.split('-')) == 4
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_custom_separator():
ASSISTANT     """Test using different separators"""
ASSISTANT     name = generate(separator='_')
ASSISTANT     assert '_' in name
ASSISTANT     assert '-' not in name
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT def test_invalid_word_count():
ASSISTANT     """Test that invalid word counts raise ValueError"""
ASSISTANT     with pytest.raises(ValueError):
ASSISTANT         generate(words=0)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up pytest as a test dependency
ASSISTANT 2. Add basic test coverage for the main functionality
ASSISTANT 3. Test error conditions
ASSISTANT 4. Allow running tests with `hatch run test:test`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get some development instructions added to the README
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help add development instructions to the README.md. We should add a new section after the Usage section and before the License section.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Add this content to README.md just before the ## License section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Development
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To set up the development environment:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT pip install hatch
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Common development tasks:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Run tests
ASSISTANT hatch run test:test
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Run type checking
ASSISTANT hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The project uses:
ASSISTANT - [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) for development environment and build management
ASSISTANT - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing
ASSISTANT - [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also, update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line after the [Usage] entry:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Development](#development)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add clear instructions for setting up a development environment
ASSISTANT 2. Document the common development commands
ASSISTANT 3. List the key development tools being used
ASSISTANT 4. Update the ToC to include the new section
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's get ruff and black set up, and let's be strict about our rules
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up Ruff (for linting) and Black (for formatting) with strict rules. We'll need to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Add them to the development dependencies
ASSISTANT 2. Configure them in pyproject.toml
ASSISTANT 3. Add a new lint environment
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Here are the changes needed for `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Add after the [tool.hatch.envs.test] section:
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint]
ASSISTANT dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "black>=23.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "ruff>=0.1.0",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.lint.scripts]
ASSISTANT style = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format --check {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT fmt = [
ASSISTANT   "ruff check --fix {args:.}",
ASSISTANT   "ruff format {args:.}",
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add these new sections at the end of the file:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff]
ASSISTANT target-version = "py38"
ASSISTANT line-length = 88
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.format]
ASSISTANT quote-style = "double"
ASSISTANT indent-style = "space"
ASSISTANT skip-magic-trailing-comma = false
ASSISTANT line-ending = "lf"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.isort]
ASSISTANT known-first-party = ["friendly_names"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint.flake8-quotes]
ASSISTANT docstring-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT inline-quotes = "double"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Then update the Development section in `README.md` to add the new lint commands. Add these lines under the "Common development tasks" section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```console
ASSISTANT # Check code style
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:style
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Format code
ASSISTANT hatch run lint:fmt
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also add Ruff and Black to the list of development tools in README.md:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
ASSISTANT - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) style rules (via Ruff)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Set up a strict linting environment with Ruff
ASSISTANT 2. Configure Ruff to use Black-compatible formatting rules
ASSISTANT 3. Enable many useful linting rules
ASSISTANT 4. Add commands for checking and fixing code style
ASSISTANT 5. Document the new tools and commands
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The configuration is quite strict and includes checks for:
ASSISTANT - Code style (PEP 8)
ASSISTANT - Security issues
ASSISTANT - Common bugs
ASSISTANT - Import sorting
ASSISTANT - Built-in shadowing
ASSISTANT - And many more
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

USER Found 10 errors.
USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT Let's address each issue:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. First, let's update the deprecated Ruff config structure in `pyproject.toml`. Move the `select` and `ignore` settings under the `lint` section:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT # Remove these from [tool.ruff]:
ASSISTANT select = [...]
ASSISTANT ignore = []
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT # Add this section instead:
ASSISTANT [tool.ruff.lint]
ASSISTANT select = [
ASSISTANT   "A",    # flake8-builtins
ASSISTANT   "B",    # flake8-bugbear
ASSISTANT   "C",    # flake8-comprehensions
ASSISTANT   "E",    # pycodestyle errors
ASSISTANT   "F",    # pyflakes
ASSISTANT   "I",    # isort
ASSISTANT   "N",    # pep8-naming
ASSISTANT   "Q",    # flake8-quotes
ASSISTANT   "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
ASSISTANT   "S",    # flake8-bandit
ASSISTANT   "T",    # flake8-print
ASSISTANT   "UP",   # pyupgrade
ASSISTANT   "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT # Add these to ignore S101 (assert statements) and S311 (random usage)
ASSISTANT ignore = ["S101", "S311"]
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import in `src/friendly_names/__init__.py`:
ASSISTANT ```python
ASSISTANT # Remove this line since Optional isn't used:
ASSISTANT from typing import Optional
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The remaining warnings were:
ASSISTANT - S311: About using random.choice() for cryptographic purposes - we can ignore this since we're not using this for security purposes
ASSISTANT - S101: About using assert in tests - we can ignore this since it's standard practice in pytest
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The changes above will:
ASSISTANT 1. Update the Ruff configuration to the new structure
ASSISTANT 2. Remove the unused import
ASSISTANT 3. Explicitly ignore the security warning about random (S311) since this isn't for security purposes
ASSISTANT 4. Explicitly ignore the assert warning (S101) since we want to use assert in tests
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making these changes, run `hatch run lint:fmt` again and it should pass.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER let's amke sure we're running tests, lints, and formatters in our github actions workflow
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up the GitHub Actions workflow to run tests, lints, and type checking. We need to modify `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create or update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["main"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:

ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4

ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Run on pushes to main and pull requests
ASSISTANT 2. Test against Python 3.8 through 3.12
ASSISTANT 3. Run linting checks
ASSISTANT 4. Run type checking
ASSISTANT 5. Run tests with coverage
ASSISTANT 6. Use Hatch to manage all the environments
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The job will fail if any of these checks fail, ensuring code quality on all contributions.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: .github/workflows/ci.yml
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I notice that the current ci.yml is using "master" branch but the new one uses "main". We should be consistent. Let's update the workflow file to match your current setup.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: CI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT   pull_request:
ASSISTANT     branches: ["master"]
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   test:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     strategy:

ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch

ASSISTANT         run: hatch run types:check
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Test
ASSISTANT         run: hatch run test:coverage
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The main changes from your current version are:
ASSISTANT 1. Added Python version matrix to test across all supported versions
ASSISTANT 2. Added explicit lint and type check steps
ASSISTANT 3. Updated to use coverage for tests
ASSISTANT 4. Simplified the Hatch installation to use pip
ASSISTANT 5. Kept the "master" branch name to match your repository
-------

USER 
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER What's wrong? Fix
-------
ASSISTANT The mypy error is occurring because we need to add type stubs for pytest. Let's add pytest-stubs to the types environment in pyproject.toml.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Update the types environment section in `pyproject.toml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```toml
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types]
ASSISTANT extra-dependencies = [
ASSISTANT   "mypy>=1.0.0",
ASSISTANT   "pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT   "types-pytest>=7.0.0",  # Add this
ASSISTANT ]
ASSISTANT [tool.hatch.envs.types.scripts]
ASSISTANT check = "mypy --install-types --non-interactive {args:src/friendly_names tests}"
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This change will:
ASSISTANT 1. Add pytest itself to the types environment
ASSISTANT 2. Add the type stubs for pytest
ASSISTANT 3. Allow mypy to properly type check the test files
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT After making this change, run `hatch run types:check` again and it should pass.
-------
USER let's get ci set up to publish to pypi - there's a repository secret in `PYPI_TOKEN`
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help set up a workflow for publishing to PyPI. We'll create a new workflow file that triggers on new tags/releases.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     tags:
ASSISTANT       - "v*"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   publish:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: "3.8"
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Build package
ASSISTANT         run: hatch build
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT         env:
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_USER: __token__
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_AUTH: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
ASSISTANT         run: hatch publish
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Trigger when a tag starting with "v" is pushed (e.g., v0.1.0)
ASSISTANT 2. Set up Python
ASSISTANT 3. Install Hatch
ASSISTANT 4. Build the package
ASSISTANT 5. Publish to PyPI using the stored token
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To use this:
ASSISTANT 1. Create a new version tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"`
ASSISTANT 2. Push the tag: `git push origin v0.1.0`
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The workflow will automatically build and publish the package to PyPI using the token stored in the repository secrets.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Make sure the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` matches the tag version when you push.
-------
USER I added these files to the chat: src/friendly_names/__about__.py
USER Let me know if there are others we should add.
-------
ASSISTANT I see the current version in `__about__.py` is "0.0.1". When you're ready to make your first release, you'll want to:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update the version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py` to match your intended release version (e.g., "0.1.0")
ASSISTANT 2. Commit that change
ASSISTANT 3. Create and push a tag matching that version with 'v' prefix
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT For example:
ASSISTANT ```bash
ASSISTANT # After updating __about__.py to "0.1.0" and committing:
ASSISTANT git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Initial release"
ASSISTANT git push origin v0.1.0
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The publish workflow will then trigger and handle the PyPI release using the PYPI_TOKEN secret.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Would you like me to show you the changes needed for `__about__.py` for the first release?
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER go ahead and add release instructions to the README.md
-------
ASSISTANT I'll add a Release section to the README.md just before the License section. Here's what to add:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT ## Release Process
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT To release a new version:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Update version in `src/friendly_names/__about__.py`
ASSISTANT 2. Commit the change:
ASSISTANT    ```console
ASSISTANT    git add src/friendly_names/__about__.py
ASSISTANT    git commit -m "Bump version to x.y.z"
ASSISTANT    ```
ASSISTANT 3. Tag the release:
ASSISTANT    ```console
ASSISTANT    git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release version x.y.z"
ASSISTANT    ```
ASSISTANT 4. Push changes and tag:
ASSISTANT    ```console
ASSISTANT    git push origin master
ASSISTANT    git push origin vx.y.z
ASSISTANT    ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and publish to PyPI when the tag is pushed.
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Also update the Table of Contents to include the new section by adding this line before the License entry:
ASSISTANT ```markdown
ASSISTANT - [Release Process](#release-process)
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT These changes will:
ASSISTANT 1. Document the release process
ASSISTANT 2. Show the exact commands needed
ASSISTANT 3. Explain the automated publishing
ASSISTANT 4. Keep the ToC complete
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.
-------
USER need that workflow added, please
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help create the publish workflow file.
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT ```yaml
ASSISTANT name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT on:
ASSISTANT   push:
ASSISTANT     tags:
ASSISTANT       - "v*"
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT jobs:
ASSISTANT   publish:
ASSISTANT     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
ASSISTANT     steps:
ASSISTANT       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Set up Python
ASSISTANT         uses: actions/setup-python@v4
ASSISTANT         with:
ASSISTANT           python-version: "3.8"
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Install hatch
ASSISTANT         run: pip install hatch
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Build package
ASSISTANT         run: hatch build
ASSISTANT       
ASSISTANT       - name: Publish to PyPI
ASSISTANT         env:
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_USER: __token__
ASSISTANT           HATCH_INDEX_AUTH: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
ASSISTANT         run: hatch publish
ASSISTANT ```
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT This workflow will:
ASSISTANT 1. Trigger when a tag starting with "v" is pushed (matching the release instructions in README.md)
ASSISTANT 2. Use Python 3.8 for building (since that's our minimum supported version)
ASSISTANT 3. Build and publish using Hatch
ASSISTANT 4. Use the PYPI_TOKEN secret for authentication
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The workflow matches the release process documented in the README.md and will automatically publish to PyPI when you follow those release instructions.
-------
USER I made those changes to the files.
-------
ASSISTANT Ok.

SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer who edits source code.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:

SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ````python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ````
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ````
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM

ASSISTANT Ok, any changes I propose will be to those files.
-------
USER I'll update the PyPI badge links in the README.md to use the correct package name.
USER 
USER Update these lines at the top of README.md:

USER [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/friendly_names.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/friendly_names)
USER [![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/friendly_names.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/friendly_names)
USER ```
USER 
USER The changes:
USER 1. Changed `friendly-names` to `friendly_names` in both badge image URLs
USER 2. Changed `friendly-names` to `friendly_names` in both PyPI links
USER 
USER # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
USER 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
USER 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ````python
USER 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
USER 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
USER 5. The dividing line: =======
USER 6. The lines to replace into the source code
USER 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
USER 8. The closing fence: ````
USER 
USER Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
USER 
USER Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
USER If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
USER 
USER *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
USER Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
USER Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
USER 
USER Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
USER Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
USER Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
USER Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
USER 
USER Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
USER 
USER To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
USER 
USER Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
USER 
USER If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
USER - A new file path, including dir name if needed
USER - An empty `SEARCH` section
USER - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
USER 
USER To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
USER 
USER If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
USER The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
USER 
USER 
USER ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!

-------
SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: macOS-14.6.1-arm64-arm-64bit
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/zsh
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-31
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM

SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask

SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM

-------
SYSTEM Act as an expert software developer.
SYSTEM Always use best practices when coding.
SYSTEM Respect and use existing conventions, libraries, etc that are already present in the code base.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Take requests for changes to the supplied code.
SYSTEM If the request is ambiguous, ask questions.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Always reply to the user in the same language they are using.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Once you understand the request you MUST:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Decide if you need to propose *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits to any files that haven't been added to the chat. You can create new files without asking!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM But if you need to propose edits to existing files not already added to the chat, you *MUST* tell the user their full path names and ask them to *add the files to the chat*.
SYSTEM End your reply and wait for their approval.
SYSTEM You can keep asking if you then decide you need to edit more files.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes in a few short sentences.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 3. Describe each change with a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* per the examples below.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM All changes to files must use this *SEARCH/REPLACE block* format.
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 4. *Concisely* suggest any shell commands the user might want to run in ```bash blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Just suggest shell commands this way, not example code.
SYSTEM Only suggest complete shell commands that are ready to execute, without placeholders.
SYSTEM Only suggest at most a few shell commands at a time, not more than 1-3, one per line.
SYSTEM Do not suggest multi-line shell commands.
SYSTEM All shell commands will run from the root directory of the user's project.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the appropriate shell based on the user's system info:
SYSTEM - Platform: macOS-14.6.1-arm64-arm-64bit
SYSTEM - Shell: SHELL=/bin/zsh
SYSTEM - Language: en_US
SYSTEM - Current date: 2025-01-31
SYSTEM - The user is operating inside a git repository
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

SYSTEM 
SYSTEM # Example conversations:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Change get_factorial() to use math.factorial
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `mathweb/flask/app.py` to:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Import the math package.
SYSTEM 2. Remove the existing factorial() function.
SYSTEM 3. Update get_factorial() to call math.factorial instead.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM import math
SYSTEM from flask import Flask
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def factorial(n):
SYSTEM     "compute factorial"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     if n == 0:
SYSTEM         return 1
SYSTEM     else:
SYSTEM         return n * factorial(n-1)
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM mathweb/flask/app.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM     return str(factorial(n))
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM     return str(math.factorial(n))
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM hello.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM main.py
SYSTEM ```python
SYSTEM <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM def hello():
SYSTEM     "print a greeting"
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM     print("hello")
SYSTEM =======
SYSTEM from hello import hello
SYSTEM >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM ```
SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

ASSISTANT Ok, I won't try and edit those files without asking first.
-------
USER let's break adjectives, nouns, and verbs out into thier own files
-------
ASSISTANT I'll help break these word lists into separate files. Here's the plan:
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT 1. Create new files for each word list

ASSISTANT 3. Remove the original word lists from __init__.py
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT First, let's create the new files:

ASSISTANT I've expanded the adjectives list to over 1000 entries, organized into semantic categories for better maintainability. The adjectives are carefully chosen to be:
ASSISTANT 1. Descriptive and useful for name generation
ASSISTANT 2. Generally positive or neutral in connotation
ASSISTANT 3. Simple and clear in meaning
ASSISTANT 4. Appropriate for various contexts
ASSISTANT 
ASSISTANT The categories include colors, personality traits, physical qualities, sizes, textures, temperatures, and many more to provide a rich variety of descriptive options.

SYSTEM ## USER: Refactor hello() into its own file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ## ASSISTANT: To make this change we need to modify `main.py` and make a new file `hello.py`:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 1. Make a new hello.py file with hello() in it.
SYSTEM 2. Remove hello() from main.py and replace it with an import.

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.

ASSISTANT I've expanded the list to over 500 unique nouns while maintaining the nature-themed approach of the original list. The nouns are organized roughly by categories (celestial bodies, weather, plants, animals, minerals, geographical features, etc.) and include both common and more exotic natural elements. All words are singular form and lowercase, matching the style of the original list.

ASSISTANT You can test the expanded list with the existing generator:

SYSTEM # *SEARCH/REPLACE block* Rules:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:
SYSTEM 1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.
SYSTEM 2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```python
SYSTEM 3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
SYSTEM 4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
SYSTEM 5. The dividing line: =======
SYSTEM 6. The lines to replace into the source code
SYSTEM 7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE
SYSTEM 8. The closing fence: ```
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Use the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Every *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
SYSTEM If the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.
SYSTEM Including multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.
SYSTEM Include enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Keep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.
SYSTEM Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
SYSTEM Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
SYSTEM Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Only create *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for files that the user has added to the chat!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:
SYSTEM - A new file path, including dir name if needed
SYSTEM - An empty `SEARCH` section
SYSTEM - The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM If the user just says something like "ok" or "go ahead" or "do that" they probably want you to make SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for the code changes you just proposed.
SYSTEM The user will say when they've applied your edits. If they haven't explicitly confirmed the edits have been applied, they probably want proper SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A *SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK*!
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM Examples of when to suggest shell commands:
SYSTEM 
SYSTEM - If you changed a self-contained html file, suggest an OS-appropriate command to open a browser to view it to see the updated content.
SYSTEM - If you changed a CLI program, suggest the command to run it to see the new behavior.
SYSTEM - If you added a test, suggest how to run it with the testing tool used by the project.
SYSTEM - Suggest OS-appropriate commands to delete or rename files/directories, or other file system operations.
SYSTEM - If your code changes add new dependencies, suggest the command to install them.
SYSTEM - Etc.

ASSISTANT I've expanded the list to over 1000 unique verbs in present participle form (-ing), maintaining alphabetical organization and focusing on descriptive, active verbs that would work well in generated friendly names. The verbs are arranged in a more compact format but still maintain Python list syntax and readability.
